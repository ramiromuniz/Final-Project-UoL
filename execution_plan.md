Task 1: Finalize Data Preparation (You are here)

Action: Split model_input_df into training and validation DataFrames (train_df, val_df).
Action: Create tf.data.Dataset objects (train_dataset, val_dataset) from these DataFrames, incorporating the image loading and preprocessing function (as per my previous "Step 4" response).
Task 2: Model Definition (MobileNetV2)

Action: Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model from tf.keras.applications, excluding its top classification layer (include_top=False). Specify input shape.
Action: Freeze the weights of the pre-trained base layers to prevent them from being updated during initial training (base_model.trainable = False).
Action: Add your custom classification head on top of the MobileNetV2 base. This typically involves:
tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D() to flatten the features from the base.
tf.keras.layers.Dropout() for regularization (optional but recommended).
tf.keras.layers.Dense() with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (outputting a single probability).
Action: Create the full model by linking the base and the custom head.
Action: Compile the model using model.compile(). Specify:
optimizer: e.g., tf.keras.optimizers.Adam().
loss: tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy() for binary classification.
metrics: e.g., ['accuracy', tf.keras.metrics.Precision(), tf.keras.metrics.Recall()].
Task 3: Model Training

Action: Define callbacks:
tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint: To save the best model (based on validation loss or accuracy) during training.
tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping: To stop training if the validation performance doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs, preventing overfitting and saving time.
tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau: To reduce the learning rate if the validation loss plateaus (optional).
Action: Train the model using model.fit():
Pass train_dataset and validation_data=val_dataset.
Specify the number of epochs.
Pass the callbacks.
Action: Store the training history returned by model.fit().
Task 4: Model Evaluation (on Validation Data & Training History)

Action: Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss curves from the history object. This helps visualize learning progress and identify overfitting.
Action: (Keras does this during fit, but you can also explicitly call model.evaluate(val_dataset) if needed).
Task 5: Model Testing (Using a Separate, Unseen Test Set)

Action: Prepare your test data (mass_test_df, calc_test_df). This will involve the same path fixing and dicom_info.csv linking logic you used for the training data to get image paths and labels.
Action: Create a test_dataset using tf.data.Dataset with the same preprocessing as the training/validation data.
Action: Load your best saved model (from ModelCheckpoint).
Action: Make predictions on the test_dataset using model.predict().
Action: Calculate and report performance metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve and AUC score (Area Under the Curve)
Task 6: (Optional) Fine-Tuning

Action: If initial results are promising, you can try unfreezing some of the top layers of the MobileNetV2 base model.
Action: Re-compile the model, usually with a much lower learning rate.
Action: Continue training for a few more epochs, monitoring validation performance closely.
Task 7: Saving the Final Model

Action: Save your fully trained (and possibly fine-tuned) model for future inference or deployment using model.save().
